# References

A reference variable is an alias, that is, another name for an already existing variable. Once a reference is initialized with a variable, either the variable name or the reference name may be used to refer to the variable.

## References vs Pointers

References are often confused with pointers but three major differences between references and pointers are âˆ’

- You cannot have NULL references. You must always be able to assume that a reference is connected to a legitimate piece of storage.
- Once a reference is initialized to an object, it cannot be changed to refer to another object. Pointers can be pointed to another object at any time.
- A reference must be initialized when it is created. Pointers can be initialized at any time.

References are often used for function argument lists and function return values.
