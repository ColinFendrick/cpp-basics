# Pointers

Every variable is a memory location and every memory location has its address defined which can be accessed using ampersand
operator which denotes an address in memory.

A __pointer__ is a variable whose value is the address of another variable.
Like any variable or constant, you must declare a pointer before you can work with it.
The general form of a pointer variable declaration is âˆ’ `type *var-name;`.

## Using Pointers

There are few important operations, which we will do with the pointers very frequently.

- We define a pointer variable.
- Assign the address of a variable to a pointer.
- Finally access the value at the address available in the pointer variable. This is done by using unary operator * that returns the value of the variable located at the address specified by its operand.
